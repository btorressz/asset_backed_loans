# asset_backed_loans

This is a Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) application that enables users to obtain loans backed by assets as collateral. The application leverages the Solana blockchain and SPL tokens for fast and low-cost transactions. Collateral can be deposited, loans issued, and repaid, with flexible interest rates and duration. If a loan is not repaid within the agreed timeframe, the collateral can be liquidated. This project was made in Solana Playground IDE

## Features

1. **Collateral Deposit**: Users can deposit collateral (e.g., SPL tokens) into a program-derived address (PDA) that locks the assets.
2. **Loan Issuance**: Loans are issued as SPL tokens based on the value of the deposited collateral.
3. **Loan Repayment**: Borrowers can repay the loan along with accrued interest to retrieve their collateral.
4. **Liquidation**: If a loan isn't repaid on time, the collateral can be liquidated after a grace period.
5. **Collateral Withdrawal**: Partial collateral withdrawal is allowed if enough collateral remains to cover the loan.
6. **Loan Refinancing**: Borrowers can refinance their loan to extend the duration or change the interest rate.

## How It Works

### Deposit Collateral
The `deposit_collateral` function allows users to deposit collateral into a PDA. The deposited amount is transferred to the program-controlled account and is locked until the loan is repaid or liquidated.

### Issue Loan
The `issue_loan` function issues a loan in SPL tokens based on the value of the deposited collateral. The value of the collateral is determined using an oracle (e.g., Pyth or Switchboard). Loans can have fixed or variable interest rates.

### Repay Loan
The `repay_loan` function allows the borrower to repay the loan amount along with any interest accrued. The borrower can repay the loan partially or in full. Once the loan is fully repaid, the collateral is unlocked and can be withdrawn.

### Liquidate Collateral
If the loan is not repaid within the loan duration and the grace period has expired, the `liquidate_collateral` function can be called by a liquidator to seize the collateral. The collateral is transferred to the liquidatorâ€™s account.

### Withdraw Collateral
The `withdraw_collateral` function allows users to withdraw part of their collateral if they have over-deposited collateral and sufficient collateral remains to back the loan.

### Refinance Loan
The `refinance_loan` function allows borrowers to modify the terms of their loan, such as extending the loan duration or changing the interest rate.

## Program Instructions

### 1. `deposit_collateral`

**Parameters**:
- `amount`: The amount of collateral to deposit.

**Description**:
Locks the specified amount of collateral into the PDA and emits a `CollateralDeposited` event.

### 2. `issue_loan`

**Parameters**:
- `loan_amount`: The amount of the loan in SPL tokens.
- `loan_duration`: The duration of the loan in seconds.
- `interest_rate`: The interest rate for the loan.

**Description**:
Issues a loan backed by the deposited collateral. The loan is issued if the collateral-to-loan ratio is within the allowed limits (150% collateralization required). The SPL tokens are minted to the borrower.

### 3. `repay_loan`

**Parameters**:
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to repay.

**Description**:
Repays the loan along with any accrued interest. Once the loan is fully repaid, the collateral is unlocked.

### 4. `liquidate_collateral`

**Description**:
Liquidates the collateral if the loan duration and grace period have expired. The collateral is transferred to the liquidator.

### 5. `withdraw_collateral`

**Parameters**:
- `amount`: The amount of collateral to withdraw.

**Description**:
Withdraws part of the collateral if the remaining collateral is sufficient to cover the loan.

### 6. `refinance_loan`

**Parameters**:
- `new_duration`: The new loan duration (optional).
- `new_interest_rate`: The new interest rate (optional).

**Description**:
Allows borrowers to modify the loan duration or interest rate.

## Data Structures

### CollateralAccount

The `CollateralAccount` stores data related to the user's collateral and loan:

- `owner`: The owner of the collateral.
- `amount`: The amount of collateral locked.
- `loan_issued_at`: The timestamp when the loan was issued.
- `loan_duration`: The loan duration in seconds.
- `loan_interest_rate`: The interest rate for the loan.

### Events

- **CollateralDeposited**: Emitted when collateral is deposited.
- **LoanRepaid**: Emitted when a loan is repaid.
- **CollateralLiquidated**: Emitted when collateral is liquidated.
- **CollateralWithdrawn**: Emitted when collateral is withdrawn.
- **LoanRefinanced**: Emitted when a loan is refinanced.

### Error Codes

- **InsufficientCollateral**: The collateral is insufficient for the loan.
- **NoCollateralDeposited**: No collateral has been deposited.
- **LoanNotExpired**: The loan has not yet expired.
- **InsufficientRepayment**: The repayment amount is insufficient to cover the loan and interest.
- **InsufficientCollateralRemaining**: The remaining collateral is insufficient to back the loan.
