# asset_backed_loans

This is a Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) application that enables users to obtain loans backed by assets as collateral. The application leverages the Solana blockchain and SPL tokens for fast and low-cost transactions. Collateral can be deposited, loans issued, and repaid, with flexible interest rates and duration. If a loan is not repaid within the agreed timeframe, the collateral can be liquidated.
