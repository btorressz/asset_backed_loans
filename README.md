# asset_backed_loans

This is a Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) application that enables users to obtain loans backed by assets as collateral. The application leverages the Solana blockchain and SPL tokens for fast and low-cost transactions. Collateral can be deposited, loans issued, and repaid, with flexible interest rates and duration. If a loan is not repaid within the agreed timeframe, the collateral can be liquidated.

## Features

1. **Collateral Deposit**: Users can deposit collateral (e.g., SPL tokens) into a program-derived address (PDA) that locks the assets.
2. **Loan Issuance**: Loans are issued as SPL tokens based on the value of the deposited collateral.
3. **Loan Repayment**: Borrowers can repay the loan along with accrued interest to retrieve their collateral.
4. **Liquidation**: If a loan isn't repaid on time, the collateral can be liquidated after a grace period.
5. **Collateral Withdrawal**: Partial collateral withdrawal is allowed if enough collateral remains to cover the loan.
6. **Loan Refinancing**: Borrowers can refinance their loan to extend the duration or change the interest rate.
